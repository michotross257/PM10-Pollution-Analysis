## Overview

Two projects analyzing data of air pollution in Oslo, Norway.

### What is PM<sub>10</sub> air pollution?

PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution)–the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. PM<sub>10</sub> (coarse particles) describes inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller.

### Data
Subsample of 500 observations from a data set collected by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in the neighborhood of Alnabru in Oslo, Norway between October 2001 and August 2003.

Dataset can be found here: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/PM10.dat

## Objectives

**Project 1**
1. Model PM10 concentration as a result of the given explanatory variables
2. Determine if the average level of pollution is different according to:
  - time of day
  - season

**Project 2**
1. Compare various the performance of various models
  - Ordinary Least Squares
  - ANOVA
  - Lasso
  - Ridge Regression  
2. Visualize the data in two dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Are there separable classes?

## Results
*See presentations for analysis and conclusions.*
